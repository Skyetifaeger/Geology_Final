      <h2>About the Unified Geologic Map of the Moon</h2>
      <p>
        The Unified Geologic Map of the Moon, created in 2020, is a comprehensive map that provides detailed information about the geology of the Moon's surface. It was a collaborative effort involving scientists and researchers from various space agencies, including NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The map combines data from multiple lunar missions, including the Apollo missions, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), and Clementine mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this map is to help scientists and researchers better understand the geological history of the Moon and to aid in the planning of future lunar missions. It provides valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of different geological features, such as craters, maria, highlands, and other formations. By studying the Moon's geology, scientists can gain insights into the Moon's formation, its volcanic and tectonic activities, and the impact history of the solar system.

      <h2>Geologic Features</h2>
      <p>
        The Moon is rich in various geologic features that provide important clues about its past. One prominent feature is craters, which are formed by the impact of meteoroids and asteroids. Craters can vary in size and shape, ranging from small, simple craters to large complex ones. Notable examples include the Copernicus crater, Tycho crater, and the famous crater Gassendi. These craters help scientists understand the history of impacts on the Moon and the processes that have shaped its surface over billions of years.

        <h3>Craters</h3>
        <p>
          Craters on the Moon are fascinating formations. They are created when a meteoroid or asteroid collides with the lunar surface, excavating a depression. Over time, the impact crater may undergo modifications due to subsequent impacts or volcanic activity. The presence of different types of craters, such as simple, complex, and multi-ring craters, provides evidence of varying impact energies and geological processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          One notable example is the Tycho crater, located in the southern highlands of the Moon. It is a relatively young crater with a prominent ray system extending outward. The rays consist of ejected material thrown out during the impact event. The study of craters like Tycho helps scientists understand the impact history of the Moon and its relationship with other bodies in the solar system.

        <h3>Maria</h3>
        <p>
          Lunar maria are large, dark, flat areas on the Moon's surface that are easily distinguishable from the surrounding highlands. They were formed by ancient volcanic activity that flooded these regions with basaltic lava flows. The maria are primarily located on the near side of the Moon and are named after the Latin word for "seas" due to their resemblance to bodies of water.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) is one of the most famous maria on the Moon. It was the landing site for the Apollo 11 mission, where humans first set foot on another celestial body. The study of lunar maria provides insights into the Moon's volcanic history and helps scientists understand the processes that shaped its surface in the past.
